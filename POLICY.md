# Exora — Work Accountability Policy (1 page)

## What Exora is

Exora is a **universal work accountability system**. It works the same for:

- **Remote** (WFH)
- **Onsite** (office)
- **Field** (client site, offline work)

We do **not** track where you are or how long you work. We track **what moved forward** and **proof** that it happened.

---

## Rules (non-negotiable)

1. **No log = no work.**  
   If you didn’t log it, we don’t count it.

2. **No proof = no log.**  
   Every work log must have at least one proof (photo, short video, document, client email, etc.).  
   Offline work is valid when you upload proof later.

3. **Repeated missing logs or commitments** are a performance issue.  
   The system shows patterns over time. Use it weekly so your work is visible.

4. **Work mode does not lower standards.**  
   Remote, onsite, hybrid, and field all have the same expectations: weekly commitment, work logs with proof, and weekly review.

## What you do every week

### Start of week (e.g. Monday)

- **Weekly commitment:** One sentence: “This week, success means: …”  
  Examples: “Client site installation completed.” “Warehouse process tested and approved.”

### During the week

- **Work logs:** Whenever you do something that moves work forward, log it.  
  Each log = one meaningful event: date, work type (Remote / Onsite / Field), “What moved forward?” (2–3 lines), and **at least one proof** (photo, video, document, client email, etc.).

### End of week (e.g. Friday)

- **Weekly review:** Answer “Was your weekly commitment achieved?” (Yes / No). If No, one-line reason.  
  The system shows your commitment, how many logs you submitted, and proof — so the picture is clear.

## What we don’t do

We do **not** use:

- GPS or location tracking  
- Biometric attendance  
- Mandatory clock-in/out  
- Random check-ins  

If you’re genuinely working, you can always describe what moved forward and show some proof. If you can’t, the issue is accountability, not where you work.

## Summary

- **One system** for everyone: remote, onsite, field.  
- **Event-based logs** with mandatory proof.  
- **Weekly commitment** and **weekly review** so progress is visible.  
- **No log = no work. No proof = no log.**
